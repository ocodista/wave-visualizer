Caio, here’s a breakdown of the functional aspects of Quantum Event Horizon:

1. Dynamic Simulation Display
• The core experience is an ever-changing, visually engaging simulation of a black hole’s event horizon.
• Users see real-time changes—like the warping of space-time, shifting distortions, and layers representing quantum fluctuations—as they explore different states of the black hole.

2. Parameter Controls
• A set of interactive controls lets users adjust key parameters such as mass, spin, and charge.
• Each parameter tweak immediately affects the simulation, altering the visual distortions and overall behavior of the black hole.

3. Real-Time Feedback Loop
• Changes in the parameters instantly update the simulation, ensuring users see immediate, intuitive responses to their interactions.
• This direct feedback enhances the exploratory and experimental nature of the app.

4. Generative Audio Experience
• The app produces ambient, evolving soundscapes that are linked to the simulation parameters.
• As users modify mass, spin, or charge, the audio shifts—reflecting phenomena like the subtle “pulses” of Hawking radiation or the deep hum of gravitational waves.

5. Immersive, Multi-Sensory Experience
• The combination of dynamic visuals and synchronized audio creates an immersive atmosphere, merging scientific concepts with an artistic touch.
• Users not only “see” the effects of quantum physics and gravity but also “feel” them through sound.

6. Optional Data-Driven Insights
• Optionally, the app can integrate real astronomical data to influence initial conditions or provide context, enhancing the simulation’s authenticity.
• This data could offer insights or trigger specific visual/audio events, bridging artistic representation with actual cosmic phenomena.

7. Educational and Exploratory Component
• Beyond the visual and auditory allure, the simulation encourages users to experiment and learn about black hole properties.
• Supplementary labels or brief explanations can highlight how each parameter relates to real astrophysical phenomena, making the experience both enlightening and engaging.

These functional elements come together to provide an interactive, educational, and artistically driven journey into the mysteries of quantum physics and black holes.
